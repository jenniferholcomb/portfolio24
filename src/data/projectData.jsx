    description: "Bend In Spoon is a dashboard forecasting tool for small restaurants. It tracks occupancy rates for local short-term rentals, cost of goods fluctuations, and provides a weekly breakdown of labor estimates, past sales, weather, events, holidays, and tourism. The app utilizes APIs for short-term rental availability, holidays, weather, and local events, and uses Firestore for data storage and Netlify's serverless functions. Designed in Figma and built in React with vanilla CSS, the project originated as my capstone project for Epicodus."

Leveraging AI technology, the app allows for efficient invoice uploads and is designed to minimize task fatigue during item counts.  The app also provides a centralized platform for managing and categorizing inventory."
