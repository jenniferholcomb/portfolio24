It tracks occupancy rates for local short-term rentals, cost of goods fluctuations, and provides a weekly breakdown of labor estimates, past sales, weather, events, holidays, and tourism. The app utilizes APIs for short-term rental availability, holidays, weather, and local events. Designed in Figma and built in React, styled with vanilla CSS, and uses Firestore for data storage. The project originated as my capstone project for Epicodus."
